Program to print out what the largest classes at Brandeis are.

How to run:

1. Install Python
2. Install selenium (pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. Download ChromeDriver and add it to your path: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
4. Run the script!

I've also included the pickle files for when I ran the script for Spring 2017.

It's insecure to load pickle objects though, so if you don't trust me, just run the script yourself.
